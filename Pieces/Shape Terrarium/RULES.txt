each cell has a shape, a color, and a direction
shapes: square, circle, triangle, star, hexagon, pentagon
colors: white, red, green, yellow, blue
directions: up, right, down, left, spinning
each cell also runs on a separate timer, and its behavior is applied in "ticks"; the length of a cell's tick is usually
a random number between a minimum and a maximum, but sometimes the minimum and maximum times are the same and therefore
constant

each shape has a different behavior and a different way of reproducing
a cell's "neighbors" is the 8 surrounding cells

all of the following rules are applied to/by a cell every time it ticks

SQUARES
non-spinning squares have a minimum tick length of 0.6s and and a maximum of 3.0s
each non-square neighbor of a square has a 2% chance to turn into a square, with the exception of 
triangles. when a cell is transformed in this way, it does not tick until the animation finishes

if a square has 4 or more square neighbors, and there are no spinning squares on the board, there is a 1% chance
for it to turn into a spinning square. when a square transforms into a spinning square, its tick length is 
immediately set to a minimum and maximum of 0.5s

spinning squares have their tick length decreased by 0.03s, and cycle through all of the colors in order
if a spinning square's tick length is at or below zero, it explodes, turning all of the cells in its 5x5 
area into a random color and shape after a random interval from 0.0s to 2.0s (for each transformed cell)
when a cell is transformed in this way, it does not tick until the animation finishes

TRIANGLES
triangles have a minimum tick length of 1.0s and a maximum of 3.0s
triangles have a 10% chance to rotate left, a 10% chance to rotate right, 
and a 30% chance to move forwards, swapping positions with the cell in front of it
if a triangle moves against an edge, it turns the cells to its left and right (relative to facing direction)
into triangles

blue triangles have different tick lengths, having a minimum of 0.1s and a maximum of 0.5s
however, they are not able to convert other cells into triangles

STARS
stars have no ticking behavior, but are "triggered" whenever a square or hexagon attempts to change its shape
when a star is triggered, if it has at least one star neighbor, it transforms as normal and changes a random
neighboring star to a random color
otherwise, if there are no star neighbors, it explodes, changing the color of all of the cells in its 5x5 area 
into its color, and turning 50% of them into stars (via random chance)

HEXAGONS
hexagons always have a tick duration of 0.4s
if, among all of its hexagonal neighbors, there is exactly one hexagon with a lower "color value" than itself
(colors have a value corresponding to the order they're listed at the start), it will attempt to get the neighbor
in the opposite direction of the other hexagon. if no such neighbor exists, or a 6% chance is rolled, it will
instead pick a neighbor in one of the other 2 cardinal directions (decided by random chance)
if the neighbor is an existing cell (not outside of the board), the inciting hexagon will first swap the other hexagon
with the chosen other neighbor, and then swap the colors of itself and the other hexagon (now in the initial 
position of the other neighbor)
this results in hexagons of 2 different colors forming a head and a tail and moving forwards, sometimes turning

if a hexagon has zero hexagonal neighbors, for each neighbor of that hexagon that isn't the same color,
it has a 0.5% chance of transforming into a hexagon. when a cell is transformed in this way, it does not 
tick until the animation finishes

CIRCLES
circles have a minimum tick length of 0.6s and and a maximum of 3.0s
if a circle has 4 or more neighbors with the same color as itself, it has a 20% chance at "spreading"
when a *cell* spreads, it will wait a random interval between 0.2 and 1.0 seconds (interrupting its own ticking)
and turn into a circle of the color of the cell that caused it to spread. afterwards, it will cause all 
non-circle neighbors of the same color to also "spread"

PENTAGONS
non-spinning pentagons have no ticking behavior
when a non-spinning pentagon would be transformed into a different shape, and it is the only pentagon on the board,
it will "resist" changing shape and turn into a white spinning pentagon instead

spinning pentagons cannot change shape whatsoever
spinning pentagons have a tick length equal to 
(3.0 - (amount of spinning pentagons anywhere * 0.1)) seconds, clamped between 0.05s and 3.0s
non-white spinning pentagons will turn white
each non-spinning or non-pentagon neighbor of a spinning pentagon has a ((amount of spinning pentagons anywhere)% chance
to turn into a white spinning pentagon

====

due to the weird nature of the code (as a consequence of me haphazardly throwing this together, more thoughts on that in
shape.gd) there are tiny differences and nuances not included here. on one hand it kinda hurts the sanctity of 
it acting similarly simple as a typical cellular automata, but also it does kind of contribute to the weird chaotic 
bug-like nature of the shapes so idk!! i might revisit the idea later though :3
